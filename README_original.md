# Mechanic Ideation Assistant (MIA) ðŸŽ®

A Streamlit web application that helps game designers brainstorm video game mechanics through narrative prompts, analogical reasoning, and cognitive design principles.

## Features

### Core Ideation Workflow
- **Step-by-step cognitive process** for systematic mechanic ideation
- **Narrative prompt selection** from curated list or custom input
- **Inspiration source selection** from games, movies, and anime
- **Mechanic schema selection** for focused design thinking
- **Multi-dimensional rating system** for Fun, Novelty, and Visual Appeal
- **Cognitive-enhanced suggestion generation** with design rationale
- **Idea locking and comprehensive export** functionality

### Cognitive Design Support
- **Guided cognitive strategies** for each design step:
  - Pattern Recognition (Step 2) - Identify familiar patterns from inspiration sources
  - Analogical Reasoning (Step 3) - Draw parallels between different domains
  - Constraint Analysis (Step 4) - Work within design constraints to enhance creativity
  - Mental Simulation (Step 5) - Mentally test ideas before implementation
- **Working memory support** with persistent context display
- **Design thinking capture** through reflection prompts
- **Cognitive rationale** for each generated mechanic suggestion with design patterns
- **Mental model descriptions** to understand player psychology

### Enhanced Suggestion Generation
- **Rule-based cognitive modeling** with design pattern recognition
- **Narrative integration** based on story element analysis
- **Inspiration source pattern mapping** for design influence
- **Constraint-based refinement** using user ratings
- **Cognitive justification** for each suggestion with:
  - Design patterns
  - Mental models
  - Cognitive rationale

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:8501`)

3. Follow the cognitive design process:
   - **Step 1**: Select a narrative prompt with thematic analysis
   - **Step 2**: Choose 1-2 inspiration sources with pattern recognition
   - **Step 3**: Pick a mechanic schema using analogical reasoning
   - **Step 4**: Rate your idea with constraint analysis
   - **Step 5**: Review cognitive-enhanced suggestions with mental simulation
   - **Step 6**: Lock in and export your complete design thinking process

## Cognitive Design Framework

This application implements cognitive design principles to guide users through proven design thinking patterns:

### Cognitive Strategy Implementation
- **Pattern Recognition Support** - Helps identify familiar patterns from inspiration sources and understand how they relate to narrative themes
- **Analogical Reasoning Guidance** - Facilitates drawing parallels between different domains and finding unexpected connections
- **Constraint Analysis Tools** - Identifies limitations that can enhance creativity and guides working within design constraints  
- **Mental Simulation Prompts** - Encourages mentally testing ideas through guided questions about player experience and edge cases

### Enhanced Suggestion Generation
- **Schema-based foundation** with cognitive rationale for each mechanic type
- **Narrative integration** through story element analysis
- **Pattern application** from inspiration sources
- **Constraint refinement** based on user ratings
- **Mental model generation** to understand player psychology
- Identifies design patterns through computational analysis of inspiration sources
- Maps patterns to narrative themes using algorithmic thematic overlap calculation
- Guides analogical connections with empirical sophistication scoring
- Provides expertise-level assessment through pattern recognition capabilities

### 6. **Evidence-Based Constraint Analysis Integration**
- Transforms limitations into creative opportunities through computational reframing
- Provides real-time design guidance with bias detection and load monitoring
- Balances competing design goals using multi-dimensional analysis algorithms
- Implements constraint-based creativity principles from cognitive psychology research

## Enhanced Features

### Cognitive Support System
- **Step-specific guidance** using proven design strategies
- **Working memory aids** to maintain design context
- **Reflection capture** to document design thinking evolution
- **Process documentation** for learning and iteration

### Advanced Suggestion Generation
- **Schema-based foundation** with cognitive rationale for each mechanic type
- **Narrative integration** through story element analysis
- **Pattern application** from inspiration sources
- **Constraint refinement** based on user ratings and cognitive load
- **Mental model generation** to understand player psychology

## Mechanic Schemas with Cognitive Foundation

The app includes 10 mechanic schemas, each with cognitive design rationale:
- **Emotion States** - Embodied cognition and mental state representation
- **Karma System** - Causal reasoning and moral cognition
- **Resource Tradeoff** - Decision-making and opportunity cost
- **Transformation** - Learning and adaptation modeling
- **Cooperation** - Social cognition and shared mental models
- **Environmental Interaction** - Ecological psychology principles
- **Memory System** - Cognitive memory and temporal reasoning
- **Social Dynamics** - Theory of mind and social cognition
- **Puzzle Integration** - Problem-solving and insight generation
- **Narrative Choice** - Decision trees and consequence modeling

## Export Features

Users can export comprehensive summaries including:
- All selected inputs and ratings
- Generated suggestions with cognitive analysis
- Complete design thinking process documentation
- Idea evolution timeline
- Cognitive reflection data
