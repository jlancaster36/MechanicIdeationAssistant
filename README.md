- **Inspiration source selection** from games, movies, and anime
- **Mechanic schema selection** for focused design
- **Rating system** for Fun, Novelty, and Visual Appeal
- **Rule-based suggestion generation** with 2-3 mechanic ideas
- **Idea locking and export** functionality
- **Clean, intuitive interface** with progress tracking

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

## How It Works

The app uses rule-based logic to generate mechanic suggestions based on:
- Selected narrative prompt
- Chosen inspiration sources
- Mechanic schema focus
- User ratings for fun, novelty, and visual appeal

Each suggestion includes:
- Detailed description
- Complexity assessment
- Innovation level
- Visual presentation notes

## Mechanic Schemas

The app includes 10 different mechanic schemas:
- Emotion States
- Karma System
- Resource Tradeoff
- Transformation
- Cooperation
- Environmental Interaction
- Memory System
- Social Dynamics
- Puzzle Integration
- Narrative Choice

## Inspiration Sources

Curated list includes popular games, movies, and anime known for innovative mechanics:
- Game series: Zelda, Dark Souls, Portal, Bioshock, Final Fantasy, etc.
- Studio Ghibli films
- Anime: Avatar: The Last Airbender
- Indie games: Undertale, Hollow Knight, Celeste, etc.

## Export Feature

Users can export their finalized ideas as markdown files containing:
- All selected inputs
- Ratings
- Generated suggestions
- Timestamp

## Development

This project uses:
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **Python 3.7+** for the backend logic
- **Session state management** for user data persistence
- **Rule-based generation** for mechanic suggestions
